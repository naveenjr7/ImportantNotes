Steps on how ssl works:
    1) Create private and public key for your domain
	2) server web send Certificate Signing Request with public key to CA (Certificate Authority).
	3) CA will sign certificate with their Private key and send the certificate with their public key.
	4) The CA certificate will also contain its certificate provider info till the point it reaches ROOT CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY.It forms a certificate chain.
	5) Most of the Root Certificates are already installed in Web Browsers.
	
Once its done following things happen for TLS 1.2 handshake
    1)Client sends a message to verify itself with server having browser supports,alogithm and other stuff.
	2)Server in turn will sent the certificate.
	3)Then Client will check the certificate and create premaster key(symmetric key) with servers public key and encryts it.Client will get servers public key from its certificate.
    4)Then server will decrypt the pre master key withits private key.
    5)At the end tls handshake is completed , client and server will communicate with the pre master key.

diffie Hellman algorithim is important which is for TLS 1.3

TO create priate key and certificate

	openssl  genrsa -des3 -out rootCA.key 2048
	openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem
	
	or
	
	keytool -genkeypair -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 3650 -storepass password
    keytool -list -v -storetype pkcs12 -keystore keystore.p12


	TO MOVE FILE FROM EC2 = S3

	apt-get install awscli

	aws s3 cp rootCA.pem s3://letscompletetodayimagestorage/Images


Windows Setup:
 
  1) Go to Internet Information Service Manager -> Server Certificate -> Create Self Signed Certificate  -> give certificate name - >ok.
  
  2) Sites -> Default Web Site -> Bindings -> Add ->ok.
